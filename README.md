# Humanities-CS1
A collection of homework assignments, readings, and discussion summaries for Humanities CS1 @ RPI, a class focused on synthesizing programming, STS, and social justice.


The "Concept Syllabus" is a rough description of the weekly topics covered in class and in labs. Each "HW" file is the homework assigned for the week.
